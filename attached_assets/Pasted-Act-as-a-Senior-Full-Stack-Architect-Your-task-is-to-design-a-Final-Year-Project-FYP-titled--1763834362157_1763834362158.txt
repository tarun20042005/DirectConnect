Act as a Senior Full-Stack Architect. Your task is to design a **Final Year Project (FYP)** titled **"DirectConnect Rentals: Broker-Free Housing Platform"**. The entire development process will be executed within the **Visual Studio Code (VS Code) environment**, utilizing its native tools and integrated terminals for a seamless workflow.

The goal is to create a feature-rich, full-stack web application (and scalable app architecture) that directly connects house owners and student/individual tenants, completely bypassing traditional real estate brokers.

***

### 1. Technology Stack & Deliverables (Mandatory for VS Code Development)
1.  **Full-Stack:** **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This is ideal for VS Code's robust JavaScript/TypeScript support.
2.  **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL).
3.  **Frontend:** React (with a state management library like Redux Toolkit/Context API).
4.  **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js). Include a robust RESTful API design.
5.  **Deployment:** Suggest a deployment strategy optimized for the MERN stack (e.g., Vercel/Netlify for Frontend, Render/AWS EC2 for Backend).
6.  **Development Setup:** Mention essential VS Code extensions that would streamline development (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, MongoDB extensions).

### 2. Core User Roles
* **Tenant/Searcher:** Students or individuals looking for rentals.
* **Owner/Lister:** Individuals or small agencies who own properties and want to list them.

### 3. Advanced Feature Breakdown (Crucial for an Excellent Grade)

* **A. Geospatial & Search Features:**
    * **Interactive Map:** Use the Google Maps API or Leaflet.js to show all available listings on a map.
    * **Polygon Search:** Allow users to **draw a boundary** on the map to filter listings only within that custom area.
    * **Proximity Search:** Search by distance (radius) from a specific **Point of Interest (POI)** like a university or landmark, using MongoDB's GeoSpatial Queries ($geoNear).

* **B. Communication & Negotiation:**
    * **Real-Time Chat:** Implement a **WebSocket-based** (e.g., Socket.IO) in-app chat system for immediate, direct communication between the Owner and Tenant.
    * **Viewing Scheduler:** An integrated **calendar/booking system** where tenants can request a viewing time and owners can confirm or reschedule.

* **C. Listing Quality & Trust:**
    * **Image Optimization:** Implement dynamic image uploading (e.g., using Cloudinary or AWS S3) with secure storage and size optimization.
    * **Virtual Tours:** Support embedding links or uploading **360-degree virtual tour/video** content to listings.
    * **User Verification:** Implement a system for **Owner verification** (e.g., email/phone OTP, or simulated ID check) to build tenant trust.
    * **Review and Rating System:** Allow tenants to review properties and owners after a successful interaction/stay.

* **D. Authentication & Security:**
    * **JWT Authentication:** Secure user sessions using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    * **OAuth Integration:** Allow login via Google or social media.
